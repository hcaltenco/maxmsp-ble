      <description>clear the internal list of found devices.</description>
    </method>
    <method name="connect"><arglist/>
      <digest>connect followed by an int will attempt connect to a found device at the given index. Connect to a device first before attempting to <m>read</m>, <m>write</m>, <m>subscribe</m> or <m>unsubscribe</m> from a device.</digest>
      <description>
        <b>connect int:</b>
        connect followed by an int will attempt connect to a found device at the given index. All Services and Characteristics will be sent out the first outlet and will bre printed if reporting is on.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>connect symbol:</b>
        connect followed by a symbol will interpret the symbol as uuid and attept to connect to the specified device. If the device has not yet been discovered this will trigger scanning and immediately connect once the device has been found.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>connect name symbol:</b>
        connect followed by name then a symbol will interpret the symbol as device name. This will connect to the first device in found devices matching the name.

    <method name="filter"><arglist/>
      <digest>filter out devices during scanning
      </digest>
      <description>
        <b>
          filter rssi int:
        </b>
        ignore devices with an RSSI higher than the int specified
        <br/><br/>
        <b>
          filter iphone int:
        </b>
        toggle ignoring apple devices with 1 to ignore and 0 to allow. Useful for thinning out scanning for Arduinos.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>
          filter services UUIDlist:
        </b>
        'filter' followed by 'services' followed by a list of symbols will scan only for devices advertising one of the listed service UUIDs. This message will trigger the scanning process if it is not already active.

      <digest>A read message will output the latest values of the speicifed characteristic from the left outlet
      </digest>
      <description>A read message is in the form: "read DEVICE SERVICE CHARACTERISTIC". Device can be either index or UUID. Service and characteristic are both UUID, 16-bit or 128-bit. A read DEVICE message will just grab all values.</description>

    <method name="scan"><arglist/>
      <digest>
        A scan message will begin scanning for BLE devices. A scan message followed by 0 or 1 will toggle scanning.

      <description>
        <b>
          scan int:
        </b>
        scan followed by 0 or 1 will toggle scanning.

        <b>
          scan symbol:
        </b>
        scan followed by a list of symbols will begin scanning for devices with any of the advertised uuids in the list

      <digest>A write message will write byte data to a characteristic of a device.
      </digest>
      <description>A "write device service characteristic bytes" message will write the list of bytes to the 'device' (index or uuid) to the "characteristic" of "service" (16-bit or 128-bit UUID). The list of bytes can be formatted as a symbol, a list of floats or a list of longs </description>
    </method>
    <method name="unsubscribe"><arglist/>
      <digest>Unsubscribe to a notifying characteristic. See also: <m>subscribe</m>
